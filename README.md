# Huffman Coding
A Python compression and decompression program based on Huffman Coding.

##Introduction

This Project is to design a compression and decompression program based on Huffman Coding.
The idea of Huffman Coding is to minimize the weighted expected length of the code by means of 
assigning shorter codes to frequently used characters and longer codes to seldom-used code.

##Implementation Details

The Program can compress and decompress text file consisting of 128 ASCII characters.



Huffman code is a data compression algorithm which uses the greedy technique for its implementation. 
This is an amazing algorithm to Learn, Understand and Implement I repeat again Learn, Understand and Implement. 
It uses many Data Structures within the Algorithm.
I know it might be overwhelming while you look at it, but this is an amazing algorithm when you understand it step-by-step.
Right from Compression to De-Compression or Coding to Decoding.
