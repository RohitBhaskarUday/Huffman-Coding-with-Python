# Huffman-Coding-with-Python
Huffman code is a data compression algorithm which uses the greedy technique for its implementation. This is an amazing algorithm to Learn, Understand and Implement I repeat again Learn, Understand and Implement. It uses many Data Structures within the Algorithm. I know it might be overwhelming while you look at it, but this is an amazing algorithm when you understand it step-by-step. Right from Compression to De-Compression or Coding to Decoding.
